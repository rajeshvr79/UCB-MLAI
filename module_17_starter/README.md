# Bank Marketing Machine Learning Project

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models using the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on a variety of features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Bank Marketing** dataset, which contains information on various attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, balance, housing loan, personal loan, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
    - Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents.
    - Identify and handle any missing values.
    - Encode categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Transform and select features for model training.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Baseline Model**:
    - Implement a baseline model using `DummyClassifier` with the strategy `"most_frequent"`.
    - Evaluate the baseline model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Modeling**:
    - Train and evaluate multiple classifiers:
        - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
        - Decision Trees
        - Logistic Regression
        - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Compare models based on their performance.

5. **Model Visualization**:
    - Visualize decision boundaries for models using 2D projections.
    - Plot confusion matrices for each model.
    - Visualize ROC curves to compare the models' performance.
    - Plot feature importance for models that support it.

6. **Findings**:
    - Summarize the key findings from the analysis and modeling.
    - Provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders.

7. **Next Steps**:
    - Suggestions for further improvements, including testing additional models, hyperparameter tuning, and more detailed feature engineering.
